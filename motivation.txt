💖 You are not behind. You are exactly where you need to be.

🌿 Healing is not linear. Some days are slow, and that’s okay.

🕊️ Take up space. Your presence is a blessing.

🌞 Even if today is heavy, the sun still rose for you.

✨ You do not have to earn rest.

📚 One chapter does not define the whole story.

🌈 You are allowed to outgrow people, thoughts, and habits.

💛 The way you care for others is beautiful—don't forget to care for yourself, too.

🌊 Feelings are waves. Let them pass; you are the ocean.
